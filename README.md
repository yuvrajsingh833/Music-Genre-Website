#Music Genre Website

Music Genre Classification
This project is a web-based application that allows users to classify the genre of a music track. Users can either record audio directly on the website or upload an existing audio file to get a genre prediction.

Project Overview
The application leverages machine learning for music genre classification, using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model trained on preprocessed audio data. The model identifies various genres by analyzing the audio's unique features.

Model Training and Testing
The project includes three main stages:

Data Preprocessing & Training - Prepares the dataset and trains the model.
Model Training with LSTM - Implements an LSTM-based architecture for genre classification.
Model Testing - Evaluates model performance on test data.
